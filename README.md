## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

## Setup
> I did a little modification for the database part of this source code. I used `pg` instead of course appointed `@vercel/postgres` library in the course book. It is slightly different in terms of database config and client API usage.

- Use PNPM
- Use Postgres@15 dockerized locally
- Seed the DB once before use, by running `pnpm run seed`

## Thoughts
Next.js is definitely different kind of approach to implement applications, it blurred border of traditional BE/FE architecture.

The learning curve will be not flat, it is much like Angular to Vue.js or React developers, plus database interactions to learn.

It is suitable for a small to medium size full-stack team, assuming all team members are familiar with the basics of React & OOP & DB. It will be a good framework to accelerate feature delivery and ease BE/FE alignment work in traditional architecture.
